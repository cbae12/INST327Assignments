-- Using aggregate function to locate accordingly
SELECT product_name AS "Product Name" , category_name AS "Category Name",
COUNT(product_id) AS "Number Purchased" , 
CONCAT(MAX(discount_percent), '%') AS "Maximum Discount",     -- To find MAXIMUM sale percent for each product
CONCAT('$', SUM(list_price * quantity - discount_amount * quantity)) AS "Discounted Order Total"		-- To find total of the product with discount
FROM products

GROUP BY product_name WITH ROLLUP;				-- ROLLUP to locate the total amount

/*Answer 2*/
